LLM Research Report 1: A Comprehensive Survey of Large Language Models
Large Language Models (LLMs) are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms trained to process, understand, and generate human language at scale.
Modern LLMs leverage transformer architectures, which use attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in text.
The rise of LLMs is enabled by access to massive text corpora, advances in GPU technology, and innovations in distributed training.
Training LLMs requires pre-training on diverse datasets, such as Common Crawl, Wikipedia, and web forums.
The GPT family (Generative Pretrained Transformer) is a prominent example, starting with GPT-1 and culminating in models like GPT-4.
Other major LLM families include LLaMA, PaLM, GLaM, LaMDA, OPT, AlexaTM, and Sparrow, each with unique use cases and specialties.
LLMs are typically characterized by billions or even trillions of parameters, such as GLaM’s 1.2 trillion and PaLM’s 540B.
