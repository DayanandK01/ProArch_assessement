LLM Research Report 2: Experimental Analysis of LLM Impact vs. Standard Web Search
This research investigates the effects of using LLMs compared to traditional web search on users’ depth of learning.
In four large-scale experiments, subjects interacted with either LLM-powered systems or conventional search engines to learn about unfamiliar topics.
Researchers measured knowledge acquisition, advice formation, investment in learning, and originality of user-generated content.
LLMs provided synthesized responses that aggregated core information from multiple sources.
Traditional search offered a list of discrete, link-based documents for users to explore and synthesize.
Experimental results indicated that users learned less deeply from LLM outputs than from traditional web search.
Passive receipt of synthesized information led to reduced exploration, reflection, and engagement.
While factual content matched, learners using LLMs developed sparser, less original insights and felt less invested.
Advice generated post-LLM interaction was found to have lower novelty and application rates.
